# matching_simulation
Simulation of the two-period matching model results, a section of my paper on matching mechanisms. I compute the value function of the players in the first period of the game.

Run `matching_simulations.py` from the terminal. I recommend inputting 7 and 0.005 when prompted. It should take around a minute to run simulations, after which `value_functions.pdf` will be saved in your current directory with the simulated graphs.
